# c-priority-queue
Made in the span of an hour. Needed a max priority queue but did not want to add a dependency. Maybe
it's efficient?

## Installation
Add this directory to your include path.

## Usage
This implementation attempts to be as generic as possible with the types of values it can store (or
at least as much as C can allow). Thus, it requires that you specify pointers to your own values.
After creation, this priority queue will allocate no additional data.
